# Cocktail Machine Project 🍹

This project presents an automated cocktail machine, controlled via a Kotlin-based mobile application. The user can sign up providing their credentials then login to the system. They can select their seats and choose their preferred cocktails from the menu within the app, which communicates with an Arduino board that operates the pumps in the machine. They can load money into their wallet in the application to make payment. This project offers an autonomous system designed to simplify and enhance the both ordering and cocktail preparation processes.
